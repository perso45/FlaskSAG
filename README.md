# FlaskSAG
FlaskSAG or Flask Site Auto Generator is just a quick little project I threw together to make a running Flask site with an HTML template quick and easy.

## Installation\
Your best bet is going to be using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) to get all the dependencies for this project up and running.
```bash
pip install flask_auto_generate_project
```
or
```bash
pip3 install flask_auto_generate_project
```
since this project uses Python3 it is best to use the latter if needed.

## Usage
There is editing that needs to be done to the actual Python code. The code generated by the project is what you are going to want to edit, specifically the HTML template generated by the project.
